                        <b>Background to the conflict</b>
                        <p>
                            In February 2014, the Kremlin-supported government of Ukraine collapsed. The demise of the regime was brought about by bitter protests over a decision by the government to reject closer relations with the European Union.
                            What followed the turmoil was the emergence of a pro-Western, pro-reform government and an energized public generally anxious to lessen Moscows's influence and committed to addressing the need for serious reforms.
                        </p>
                        <p> Ukraine's problems are not solely political and economical. Russia responded to the chnage over government in 2014 by seizing Ukraine's Crimea region and annexing it.</p>

                        <b>Improvised Explosive Devices (IED)</b>
                        <p></p>
                        <p>
                            An IED can be almost anything with any type of material and initiator. It is a "homemade" device that is designed to cause death or injury by using explosives alone or in combination with toxic chemicals, biological toxins, or radiological material. IEDs can be produced in varying sizes, functioning methods, containers, and delivery methods. IEDs can utilize commercial or military explosives, homemade explosives, or military ordnance and ordnance components.
                            They are unique in nature because the IED builder has had to improvise with the materials at hand. Designed to defeat a specific target or type of target, they generally become more difficult to detect and protect against as they become more sophisticated.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            IEDs can be hidden anywhere: on animals, planted in roads or strapped to a person. They can be detonated via cell phones or trip wires, among other methods. They can be deployed everywhere: in a combat environment or in the middle of a busy city. The adaptability of IEDs to almost any situation makes them difficult to detect.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            IEDs, or Improvised Explosives Devices, are one of the main causes of causalities among troops and exact a heavy toll on local populations.

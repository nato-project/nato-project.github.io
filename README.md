Harvard University CS171 Final Project - Ukraine IED Incidents Visualization

This project will allow the exploration of over 600 Improvised Explosive Devices incidents in Ukraine mostly over the past 2 years for the purpose of highlighting and better understanding the temporal, geographical and political patterns in that data. We will consider additional census data and election statistics to uncover potential regional patterns, as well as publicly available data about the existing con- flict in Eastern Ukraine. We intend to employ interactive visualization to generate better insights about the Ukraine IED situation.
